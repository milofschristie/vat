      I wave at the asshole returning from the void. “It was so open and lawless<br>there.” Yeah, buddy. I know all about it. Experimental animals test<br>themselves out in the pale vaginal laboratory. Browning fruits spit up the<br>world’s bile to feed hungry bipedal illnesses. When problems arise, the<br>janitor pretends to be retarded. And drone the women, women, women,<br>women, women.<br>
<br>
    Feelings takes the place of thoughts. Thoughts is pissing the bed, because<br>feelings held its hand in warm water. Thoughts is turning into seaweed<br>salad. Feelings feels like a new baby. The deathbed machine plummets,<br>as it ought, to the beginning of memory in order to reconcile something,<br>build a bridge, encourage unity, something like that. It can only travel<br>light years, so we’re still waiting for it to return.<br>

    In the cave lives a heaping woman. She stranded herself there some years<br>ago. She wears bells around her ankles and wrists. Her bells clamor when<br>she bounds up to the cave wall, her face clenching as if she’s going to<br>pass through it, but always, always, she stops just short. Under her<br>million roiling veils, she does have an interior. Somewhere. Somewhere,<br>somewhere. If you want it, you have to bring her three things:<br>
    <br>
    <ol>
<li>The transpurposed heart of a schizoid, which spent its warmer years in a body not desiring others. The schizoid must have been, in life, content or at least not tensed up all the time. Must have spoken a language with a high concentration of velar sounds or other similarly vibratory syllables. Wrapped in foil not plastic, unsalted.</li>
<li>A postcard of a bucolic<span class="s3"> location.</span></li>
<li>Orchids, indefinitely.</li>
