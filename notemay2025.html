      “I envy the digitally able”<br>
    <br>
      Cassidy: “I don’t know very much about computers, but I think they are very mysterious. Very vast. All these little worlds, motherboards and hoverboards... nostalgic galaxies inside the screen and hacking and being everywhere at once. Floating around inside the world inside the world inside the world. I wonder what it is like.”<br>
