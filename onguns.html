      <h1> On Guns </h1>
      I think it would be a good idea to group everyone together and to then give them guns. I think that this is a great idea for two reasons and two reasons alone. <br>\
    <br>
Live free or die.<br>
    <br>
Die knowing you are never free.<br>
    <br>
This system would function like this: Everyone has guns, and in each town is ruled by some guy who happened to be the mayor, the sheriff, and the pope all at once. He’s<br> the mayor so he can supply guns and make sure every 12 year old gets one, he’s the sheriff so he can shoot you when you try to take them away and he's the pope so he can <br>bless you and your sorry lot after you die. He kicks dogs and kills babies and does other morally questionable actions. He feels evil things and works them into your <br>brain in ways that feel almost spiritual. You believe these things and you confront your brothers, or what we used to call comrades about them. And that makes your <br>eyes roll. And that makes my eyes roll, and we find ourselves yet again at the end of another pointless poem and it feels awkward.<br>
