      <h2> Corey Qureshi </h2>
      <h1> I try</h1>
      <h3> after Tamas Panitz</h3>
    <br>
   I try to be good and then go outside<br>
it's too trying<br>
doesn't work for me<br>
can't keep cringing into a posture<br>
of appeasement<br>
    <br>
Life starts when the heart melts<br>
There's nothing to find on the porch<br>
The sewer's open so take a dive<br>
Lo pueblo won't have you for dinner<br>
Donuts have pork but don't stutter<br>
&nbsp;for my sake<br>
I'm listening to Ravel but if I don't<br>
&nbsp;try very hard to follow, it's lost on me<br>
    <br>
They don't press you<br>
I stabbed a basketball dead<br>
The morning is lost on untucked shirts<br>
Those without their immunizations<br>
&nbsp;always seem the saddest<br>
