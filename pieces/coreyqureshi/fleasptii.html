      <h2> Corey Qureshi </h2>
      <h1> Fleas pt. ii </h1>
    <br>
We have no pets  <br>
I am uninterested in the cottage industries  <br>
&nbsp;spawned by Arca and NTS  <br>
Spawned from Jersey as all greatness does,  <br>
&nbsp;i Laze in the dirty tub in memoriam  <br>
of a child Me damned to only standing showers  <br>
&nbsp;i Crave a future, aspire, playing the game,  <br>
having no pets, running no marathons  <br>
&nbsp;the Cult of youth displays yr veins, mine  <br>
half varicose. I think standing vs sitting is  <br>
&nbsp;the thrust of my life’s work. And standers  <br>
sit in discomfort from  <br>
a) hours of opposite  <br>
b) poor seating. Standing is poverty  <br>
and shitting a luxury earned in  <br>
&nbsp;consumption. I can’t get the  <br>
rules of this set up right. They Know.  <br>
Watching unaware comrades struggle at  <br>
&nbsp;the rules and lash out our way instead  <br>
It’s quite repulsive  <br>
I, am, dirty,, with,, confusion  <br>
and Worthy of a lash  <br>
