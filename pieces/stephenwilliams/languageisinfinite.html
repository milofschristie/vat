      <h1> Language is Infinite, You're Not </h1>
I do what is easiest, what is infinitely easy, calling on no strength from the human part of the human being I am.
<br><br>
There is a grunt near the origin tree. A brightness revealing nothing. A vague ago now is and isn't. We are hopelessly late for consciousness.
<br><br>
Nightfall speaks all the continent's dialects, nightfall afizz with voices. Above the horizon breathes an amaranth star.
<br><br>
City cupped in both your hands, city running through your hands. Your death is the star only your star's light can reach.
<br><br>
Satan was everywhere. I flex my toes in my too-large shoes. So hard to become the person for whom it is easy.
<br><br>
The geek lives entirely on atmosphere. When the geek dies they bury him in thought. Ariel's made out of air, the geek's made out of pain.

<br><br>
There's a breeze. The breeze agrees with you. But you don’t notice, your mind is elsewhere.
<br><br>
Ambulance lights at harvest, headlines screaming at the new moon.
<br><br>
Crowds of people move through the square, thoughtsteps the century's doomed heartbeat, move through my vision.
<br><br>
God is the infinite surface of a sphere.
<br><br>
What can I hope for? To scratch an itch. 
<br><br>
The nation stands by awaiting forgiveness. 
<br><br>
The world joins, separates, contains. A pause sings. 
<br><br>
