      <h1> Travels </h1>
Why make a long story of it? Blue eyes mean blood of Alexander, and all the horses descend from Bucephalus.
<br><br>
Heedless of infinity an angry cavalier produced a flaming sword. 
<br><br>
The sea keeps doing its handstands, more persuasive than fury is the sea.

The king hereby proclaims that time shall be consecrated by measuring the growth of the king's hair. Measure it against what? say his assembled subjects. The length, coxa to tarsus, of a praying mantis. What if the praying mantis grows? the people asked. Do praying mantises grow? asked the king. Everything grows, said the fool—everything.

Once the king's astrologers foretold the citizens of a particular city would rise against him. So he built another city across the river, and ordered all those with even a hint of dissident connection move. Only the few above reproach could stay. This city is our city. We are the elect, and our god the elector. Generations later we have accumulated staggering wealth. We command a continent. Why then sorrow?
