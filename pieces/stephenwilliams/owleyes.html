      <h2> Stephen Williams </h2>
      <h1> Owl Eyes </h1>
     Something owl-eyed lives just beyond events. Star-strewn region. Shimmering blue like a false fashion.
<br><br>
Our village moonlight is different from all other moonlight. I love to smell the cool air around the mouth of the well.
<br><br>
You are in the rabbit's fur. All night you harvest cold armfuls of sleep. And in the hour of your death.
<br><br>
In every corner of their dominion, ghosts wear hairshirts. Your spiritual practice yields an especially wrinkly cortex over time, good for abstract thought and introspection.
<br><br>
It's written on everyone's faces: the four elements are winning out. My brother will only go outside wearing a bee suit. My cousin has a juggernaut for a liver. My sister’s pregnant, my brother does systems analysis, my cousin’s in jail, my other sister does event planning, is married to a tattoo artist, they have a home in Naperville but go to church in Wheaton, and wait for the end of things.
<br><br>
A wind roughs the trees.
<br><br>
Did you hear the one about the angel who was afraid of the sound of his own trumpet?
<br><br>
No slant, no tint to the mind's light, it comes from almost nowhere. Surprising the mountains.
<br><br>
Skies are clearing up, and temperatures are falling. Refugees are heading to the armory for warmth.
<br><br>
A ghost gets a facelift. Water is turning into air. Mist is turning into light. 
<br><br>
This is how the weaver chose to make himself seen.
<br><br>
No word from the authorities on what form the "sacrifices" would take. 
<br><br>
You can swallow anything.
<br><br>
There is nothing in God or nature like thought.
<br><br>
