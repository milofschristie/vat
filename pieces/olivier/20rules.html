      <h1> 20 Rules </h1>
    <ol>
<li>Read to reread, then re-read the reading.</li>
<li>Let it read itself to you, let it be itself. It will read into itself.</li>
<li>Work until the object comes into itself. It knows.</li>
<li>Fail, fail again, fail better— just be a failing failure failing= it’s doing(failing) its job.</li>
<li>Sit with it, toy it, twist it, edit it, sleep with it, look at it again, run towards it, forget
about it!</li>
<li>The work isn’t itself. The work is the self. The self isn’t the self. The self is
constantly selves of self. The work is not part of the self, or the extension, it is the
self who is constantly selves of self. The self, my self, is itself. My self is the work.</li>
<li>The work is a/the my self.</li>
<li>Copy a standardised framework. And then start judging the standard.</li>
<li>Think about it tomorrow. Thought about it yesterday. Go back.</li>
<li>Collect? Hoard? It’s O.K. For art? For life? It’s O.K.</li>
<li>I am not building an archive. But I am unfortunately the archivist.</li>
<li>Translate it to redefine translation through materials.</li>
<li>It’s not art. There is no art. There is only practice.</li>
<li>Negation, negation, negation! Negation is the way for intuition.</li>
<li>Methodologies are for oneself, not necessarily for others. Methods are
communicable to others.</li>
<li>Words can do a lot— it’s actually language that ‘can only do so much’.</li>
<li>Words don’t do a lot— it’s the reader that summons its responsibilities. Words do
not actually want to commit to anything but themselves.</li>
<li>Ways of seeing…body is mind. Ways of thinking…use body to think. PS: a lot of
things aren’t worth seeing.</li>
<li>Pleasure!!!! (of the text) is to live within paradoxicality.</li>
<li>It utterly absolutely entirely doesn’t matter, as long as you/it was vulnerable and
honest! And fun? Also, yes, love is actually cringingly the answer most of the time.</li>
<li>Exhausting something doesn’t lead to ‘exhaustion’. Nothing is something, even
though most of the time, most things are nothing. To make nothing is to exhaust
the exhaustion. Only in exhaustion can call upon nothingness.</li>
