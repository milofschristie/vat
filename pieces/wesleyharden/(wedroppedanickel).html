      <h2> Wesley Harden </h2>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;W e dropped a nickel on the dust pile<br>
Spent away the portending<br>
Warbling trundles puppeteering the spews &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of an ephemeral bush that drops faded remainders )the birds tumbling on them do the same<br>
Can eyes jet to a color outside of their regular suspension?<br>
Is a warble all that bad if it’s preceded by a deafening cold force )one that dumps its energy unspeakable &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(unsuspecting)<br>
