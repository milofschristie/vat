      <h1> Notes on Eistein on the Beach </h1>
    I have not seen the great <i>Einstein on the Beach</i> but it excites me greatly. I have similar thoughts and so does my respective zeitgeist, my zeitgeist and me. It feels good and I say that with pride an extended ego, love and then hate. I hate a lot of things but returning to the great <i>Einstein on the Beach</i>, it gives me a go for the better and I appreciate that. I’m living in a shoebox that costs six grand and only a dream of <i>Einstein on the Beach</i> with a hint of Brecht brings a peace to mind. I want history very badly you see and that’s just how I am feeling about it. I feel lousy and I think no one understands the word phony anymore because if they did they would use it more often. The great  <i>Einstein on the Beach</i> would and maybe share a cohesive vernacular and imagination towards a reversal. My reversal in a regression through history is what my liking is to most greatly and i will state it again: it gets to making a lousy business and a deep hatred/resentment that i continue to glorify in the name of art and its understanding. The great and most impressive  <i>Einstein on the Beach</i> has become an inspiration to the masses and only a few may be particularly aware of that. The zeitgeist reamerges and this then is prompting to the grouping in that it begins to look at one another in most definitely a gaze and certain longings for a different setting and time and a consideration for a new geography. And now, to imagine the great  <i>Einstein on the Beach</i>.
