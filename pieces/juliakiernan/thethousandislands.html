      Dear John Ashbery,<br>
In the subway window reflection I’m watching my eyes reflect the lights along the tunnel like prehistoric slime germs crossing the as yet unsunlit globes which are my eyes. Oh dear. The station interrupted me. That it always interrupts the tunnel life, that the tunnel is beholden to the station.
<br>Love,<br> Julia<br>
